Question 3:
(min = 11464513.0, max = 20839468.0)
-
Question 4:
(min = 13671808.8746, max = 22214610.4758)
-
Question 5:
The distribution of the library sizes all increased by roughly 2 million in both the minimum and maximum after normalization.

Normalizing RNA-seq data is one of the most important steps of data processing because it can have profound effects on the results of the analysis. Normalization enables accurate comparisons of expression levels between and within samples adjusting for systematic variations; such as differences in library size between-samples (sequencing depth), as well as within-sample gene-specific effects related to gene length, and GC content. For example , larger library sizes result in higher counts for the entire sample.

-
Some of the genes make sense however, others genes do not make any sense to me at all.
-
Question 7: 
The results point towards several genes with varying numbers of small effect.
-
No, I would not say that RNA-seq expression data always give researchers a clear answer. If anything I might be more confused.
-
Question 8:
The study design of this experiment assumes that since short term exercise has been shown to increase skeletal muscle insuling sensitivity, then long term exercise should have a profound effect on skeletal muscle physiology leading to positive changes in systemic insulin and glucose levels in individuals at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. This initial assumption relates to the assumptions made when studying gene expression data; which are that gene expression levels correspond to functional product levels, that a normal cell has a standard expression profile and that changes in expression profile indicate that something important is happening. 
-
Question 9:
I would spend time and money following up on gene GRB14 because this gene encodes a growth factor receptor-binding protein that interacts with insulin receptors and insulin-like growth-factor receptors. This protein likely has an inhibitory effect on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and, in particular, on insulin receptor signaling. This gene may play a role in signaling pathways that regulate growth and metabolism. All of these point to a great candidate based on my experiment.

Extra credit 1:
{What do you expect to see?}
-
Extra credit 2:
{What did you actually see? If you did not find what you expected, what sorts of variation could account for this?}
-
Comments:
I could not figure out how to properly show my x-axis labels, but I think I was able to do everything else.
-
Suggestions:
I think everything was properly covered.
